## Buildout

Buildout is a Python-based build system

---

## Buildout

### Pro

* Close to virtualenv spirit, but better
* Builds a simple .tar.gz which can be copied to production

---

## Buildout

### Con

* System dependencies
* Not used much outside Zope/Plone community, *lacking commercial interest*
* No easy solution for managing dependencies between services

---

## Virtual machines

### Pro

* Completely reproducible enviroment
* Very well proven tech
* *Used by industry giants (Adobe, Symantec, Hewlett-Packard, CapGemini, AT&T, Nokia, ...)*
---

## Virtual machines

### Con

* Slow and heavy

---

## Docker

### Pro

* Completely reproducible environment, much faster than VMs
* Managing and linking multiple services is easy
* *Easy to distribute, including versioning (push, pull via a docker registry)*
* *Used by industry giants (Google, Amazon, Spotify, ...)*

---

## Docker

### Con

* Newer technology

---

## Conclusion

1. Docker
2. VM's
3. Buildout
